# Contributing to the Alpine project

If you are reading this, you are part of the best!
Contributions are of course more than welcome,
on any part of the Alpine project.
Contributions don't have to be about code only.
Bug reporting and suggestions for improvement are also great ways to get involved.

**Important:** This repository concerns only the development of the Alpine-Lang language,
not the editor itself.
For bugs, suggestions and other contributions to the latter,
head to its dedicated repository.

## Contributing Code

Before starting on a journey to refactor half of the source code,
be sure to check the issue to see if the feature you plan has already been discussed.
If not, open your own issue so that your contribution may integrate nicely with the project.

Plan on small incremental changes,
so that your contribution has less risk being in conflict with other development.
When it's ready, submit it by pull-request.

## Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, be sure to first check the issues to avoid creating duplicates.
If nobody reported the bug you experienced,
feel free to open an issue with as much information as possible.
In particular, be sure to include:

* A concise description of the problem you experienced.
* Whenever possible, the steps to reproduce the bug you experienced.
* A concise description of the environment you use (e.g. Operating System, Swift version, ...)

## Suggesting Improvements

Just as for bug reports, be sure to first check the issues to see if you suggestion was already made.
If not, simply open one.

Try to motivate your suggestions with examples,
ideally demonstrating how it is an improvement on the live version.
